### Why Olaf Scholz hesitates to send Ukraine heavy weapons

##### Germany has changed its defence and foreign policies, but not its mentality

Mr Scholz’s new strategy raised high hopes in the western world. Yet eight weeks into the war in Ukraine these hopes are being dashed, bit by bit. Mr Scholz refuses to support calls for a German or European embargo or tariff on Russian oil and gas. Every day Germany pays Russia tens of millions of euros for fossil fuels, even as the war grinds on.

Still more damaging has been his refusal to give Ukraine heavy weapons such as tanks. Ukraine needs them more than ever thanks to the new Russian offensive in the east. Other Europeans are exasperated by German dithering. “This is costing Germany lots of political capital in the European Union and NATO,” says Rafael Loss of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The Social Democratic Party (SPD) has typically preferred engagement with Russia to confrontation. That attitude harks back to Ostpolitik, the policy of rapprochement with Germany’s eastern neighbours (including Russia), which was launched in 1969 by Willy Brandt, a celebrated SPD chancellor.


Mr Scholz is also honouring his promise to reduce Germany’s dependence on Russian energy as fast as possible. In March Robert Habeck, his economy minister, swallowed his distaste for autocracies and travelled to the United Arab Emirates and to Qatar, one of the biggest exporters of LNG, to forge new gas-supply partnerships. Besides the two new permanent LNG terminals in Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel, the government will spend €3bn to lease four floating ones.

Yet while Mr Scholz is charging ahead with implementing his Zeitenwende, he is neglecting to win hearts and minds. Rather than tirelessly communicating the need to break with old policies on Russia, the soft- spoken Mr Scholz seems to have retreated into his shell. In a televised speech on April 18th, he failed utterly to explain why he is not authorising the delivery of heavy weaponry to Ukraine. (Germany has sent other military kit, such as anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles and ammunition.) Mr Scholz said the country should not “go it alone”. But other NATO allies are sending armoured vehicles, helicopters, heavy artillery and even fighter jets; Germany now stands out for its reticence.

But there is an air of unreality to many Germans’ attitudes: they want to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia, but they shrink from the warlike things this implies.
