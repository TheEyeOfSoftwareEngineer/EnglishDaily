### Sanctions on Russian aviation are a burden for Western firms

##### And could prove devastating for Aeroflot and other Russian airlines

The uneasy grins on the faces of the ladies [to whom he explained that Western sanctions were an act of war] hinted that they understood the implications for their long-term career prospects.

The same day that Mr Putin met its trainees, Aeroflot suspended all its international flights. By then the carrier had few places to fly.

The closure of Russian airspace is an inconvenience for European ones serving north-east Asia, which will have to divert flights to more southerly routes, adding up to two hours to flying time to Beijing. But with China still in lockdown such flights are not as numerous as before. 

It is the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion that investors in the global airline-industrial complex worry about.

Moreover, the planemakers may, like other Western businesses, feel the need to distance themselves from Russia in other ways. Boeing has already ended a contract to acquire Russian titanium for its planes; finding alternative supplies may be a problem given that Russia is the metal’s third-biggest producer. Russia’s big role in other commodities markets, from nickel to palladium, may also ripple through aero space supply chains.

Repossession is, however, made considerably harder by the closure of Russian airspace and the difficulty of getting the repo men into Russia.

All these problems, though real, pale in comparison with the woes of Russia’s airlines.

Cannibalising, engineering or acquiring uncertified spares from dodgy third parties may work for a while but is unsustainable in the longer run.

Regular maintenance to accepted international standards may soon become impossible, too. [So will] insuring Russian planes, most of which are covered through Lloyd’s of London, a marketplace for brokers and underwriters.

Even booking and payment systems, mostly outsourced to Western technology firms, may no longer function.

Before then passengers may have to board planes that have missed maintenance, are fitted with suspect spares and are uninsured. Many may opt for the train instead
