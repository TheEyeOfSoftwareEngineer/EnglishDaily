### India grapples with the new realities of the global oil market

###### The question is how to pay for Russian oil

[NOTHING SHORT of] outright war and plague [is as likely to] tank India’s economy [as much as] rising oil prices. Petroleum products made up more than a quarter of the country’s overall spending on imports last year—more than for any other big economy. Could cheap Russian crude lower the bill?

Yet overall oil trade between the countries is limited: according to India’s government, less than 1% of its oil imports last year came from Russia. [The fact (that trade is a mere trickle) is a reflection of geography rather than politics]. India bought oil from Iran, another country that faced American sanctions, until about 2019. But Iran is separated from India [only by a body of water]. By contrast, there are neither direct overland routes nor short water crossings from Russia to India.

[This time around], however, Singapore has cracked down on Russian transactions, meaning Uco cannot be used.

The problem, however, is that trade between the two countries is unbalanced: India imports more than twice as much from Russia as it exports, which would leave Russian sellers holding on to unwanted rupees. Plenty for Mr Lavrov and his hosts to chew over.
