### Russian radio voices sow fear in Ukraine war zone

The six frightened women and lone man cowering in the heart of the east Ukrainian war zone had no idea whether to believe the monotone voice -- or who was actually patrolling the streets of the besieged city of Lysychansk above their heads.



Their feverish fears vacillated between the idea that their shelter's lone entrance might get blocked by falling debris and that the Kremlin's forces might come knocking unannounced.



"We do not really know anything," her neighbour Viktoria Viktorovna added from a corner cot positioned just outside the beam of light illuminating a lone patch of the dank cellar.



Some of the women in the kindergarten basement -- so frightened they only divulge their patronymics instead of their last names for fear of being discovered and punished -- said they had not ventured outside for two months.



This paralysing isolation is being compounded by haunting Russian and Ukrainian radio broadcasts that appear over random airwaves and present contradictory news.



\- Information vacuum - The concept of warring sides filling information vacuums with propaganda is not new.



The Lysychansk broadcasts are adding to a heightened sense of paranoia that appears to reign across the utterly lawless streets of an expansive industrial zone teetering on the edge of the east Ukrainian front for weeks.



This has left people such as coalminer Oleg Zaitsev worrying as much about the identity of the armed men whizzing around in battered cars as the shells randomly falling from the sky.



The controversial topic of military men occupying civilian buildings in times of urban conflict is every-present in the propaganda war being waged over Ukraine.

Some locals seethe at the idea. Others say Ukraine has no other choice because Russia was the one that brought war onto its cities.
