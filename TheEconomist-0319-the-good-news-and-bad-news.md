### CNN+ enters the streaming business at a newsy moment

##### The war in Ukraine has got people glued to their screens

America’s original Cable News Network hopes to sate this hunger with a new format. CNN+ will launch in America on March 29th, with an international roll-out to follow. For $5.99 a month viewers will enjoy live streams of on-demand news and documentaries, plus interactive features (like the chance to submit questions to interviewees).

Nor can CNN+ afford to undermine the cable business. [Like all legacy media firms, Warner-Discovery is trying to launch a streaming lifeboat without sinking its cable mothership.] So for now, CNN is keeping its main rolling-news channel [exclusively] on cable, with separate shows for CNN+ aimed at news junkies and documentary fans.

CNN+ is a side-bet for the time being. It is also the network’s most likely future home when American cable is severed for good.
