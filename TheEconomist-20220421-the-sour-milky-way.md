### Why Egypt isn't open for business

##### Despite pro-business talk, the army grabs whatever it wants


EGYPTIANS OFTEN complain that their country produces little of value. Juhayna, the country’s largest dairy and juice maker, has been a notable exception. Its red and blue cartons are a staple in Egyptian homes. Its milk and yogurt are sold across the Middle East and Africa. It is one of the most valuable companies on Cairo’s stock exchange and a darling of foreign investors. In most countries it would be considered a national champion. But under Egypt’s military rulers it has faced a Mafia-style shakedown. Its fate illustrates the flaws of the Egyptian economy.

But it has also complained that Egypt’s government is stifling the private sector. One survey shows that it has shrunk in all but nine months since 2016. Mr Sisi makes pro-business noises in public. But his generals, who dominate chunks of the economy, make a mockery of the free market.

When it went viral she was summoned for questioning and told to shut up, or suffer the same fate. Last month she died of cancer. The regime prevented hundreds of mourners from attending her funeral.

Though GDP has grown since the bail-out in 2016, the economy is in poor shape. Egypt has failed to build up its manufacturing base. Exports are sluggish. By the latest reckoning its current-account deficit had widened to $18.4bn. The poverty rate has risen. Last month the central bank devalued the Egyptian pound by 14%. At the first sign of distress, sales of short-term treasury bills have faded. Mr Sisi has persuaded friendly Gulf states to deposit billions of dollars in the central bank and pledge investment. But cases like Juhayna’s are hardly likely to encourage foreign investors to come knocking.
