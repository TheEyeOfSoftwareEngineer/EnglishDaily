### China's zero-covid industrial complex

##### The biggest corporate winners from the country's draconian pandemic strategy

PRESIDENT XXX's zero-covid policy has been a plague on China’s firms and a headache for Western ones reliant on its suppliers and consumers. The 25m residents of Shanghai, the country’s commercial hub, have been confined to their homes since April 1st. Beijing, the capital, is teetering on the edge of lockdown. Rail and air travel on a recent national holiday were, respectively, 80% and 75% below the level during last year’s festivities. Retail spending has crashed. GDP may shrink in the second quarter.



Prospects for this zero-covid industrial complex indeed look bright. Covid testing is moving from makeshift tents on street corners into a network of semi-permanent kiosks where residents will be tested regularly for the foreseeable future; Shanghai alone will build 9,000 of them. In big cities tens of millions of people may have their throats or nasal passages swabbed every 48 hours. An analyst at Soochow Securities, a local broker, says that testing at this pace will cost China about 1.7trn yuan ($254bn) this year, or around 1.5% of GDP.



The testing frenzy is minting covid tycoons. Liang Yaoming, founder of Guang zhou Kingmed Diagnostics, which also makes tests, has become a billionaire during the pandemic. The value of shares in BGI, a `$4bn` biosciences darling, held by its founder, Wang Jian, has shot up by more than `$300m` since 2019 to about `$2bn`. Chen Haibin’s 26% stake in Dian Diagnostics is worth just shy of $1bn.



Some voices have raised concerns about the rise of covid-related big business. Guan Qingyou, an economist at the Xinrui School in Beijing, recently warned of the risk of special-interest groups “misleading and kidnapping” public policy on the pandemic. They could eventually create something akin to America’s military-industrial complex, he said in a post on Chinese social media, which has since been deleted.



Mr Guan may be on to something. Zhong Nanshan, China’s leading respiratory-disease expert, has promoted Yiling’s traditional Chinese medicines used to treat covid-19 while maintaining undisclosed links to the company, the *Financial Times* has reported. More egregiously, the chief representative of a subsidiary of Guang zhou Kingmed Diagnostics was arrested earlier this year on suspicion that he was trying to spread covid in order to benefit his business. Not quite what the Politburo ordered.
