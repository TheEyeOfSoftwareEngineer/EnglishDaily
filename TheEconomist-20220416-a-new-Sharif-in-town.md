### Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan's prime minister

###### He faces a daunting to-do list, starting with mending a broken economy

IT WAS THE old Pakistan that Imran Khan, now the country’s ex-prime minister, railed against. He promised to banish the self-serving political establishment, usher in an era of clean politics and create a new Islamic welfare state. So it was with visible glee that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, whose mother, father and grandfather have all served as prime minister, president or both, declared to lawmakers after Mr Khan’s downfall, “Welcome back to purana [old] Pakistan.”

The new prime minister is a political dynast of [precisely the sort that] Mr Khan wanted to drive out of Pakistani politics. Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of Mr Khan’s predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, runs the main opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. He lacks the charisma of his elder sibling, or indeed the crowd-pulling power of his niece, Maryam Nawaz Sharif. Instead his strength lies in his reputation as a competent administrator.

It is unclear if this stemmed from mismanagement or cold feet about the huge debts Pakistan was running up.
