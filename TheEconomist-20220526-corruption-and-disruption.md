### Trouble at the top and bottom of China's financial sector

##### The government is cracking down on crooked bankers

The protesters gathered outside the office of the banking regulator in Henan province have a simple demand: “Return our deposits.” Thousands of customers of three rural banks in the region recently discovered that they were unable to withdraw their funds. They have been cut off from at least $178m, according to Reuters, a news agency. Met with silence from local officials, many aggrieved customers descended on Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, carrying signs and chanting slogans. Videos that have circulated on Chinese social media show dozens of people kneeling in the middle of a road, disrupting traffic as they beg for their money to be returned (pictured).



With many of its cities facing pandemic-related restrictions, China’s economy is struggling. That has heaped pressure on poorly run companies and laid bare dodgy lending. A crisis in the property sector appears to explain at least some of the problems at banks. Those in trouble often have relations with land developers and other firms that are far too cosy. The three banks in Henan are majority-owned by developers (a common arrangement in China). The authorities there are chasing several people connected to the deposit crisis, including a businessman who has fled abroad, Chinese media reported.
