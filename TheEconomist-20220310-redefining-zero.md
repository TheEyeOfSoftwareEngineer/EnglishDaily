### China's scientists are looking for a way out of the zero-covid policy

###### Politicians will have the ultimate say. Omicron may force them to act

NOT SINCE the early days of the pandemic has China seen so many new, locally transmitted cases of covid-19.

Michael Osterholm, an American epidemiologist, calls Omicron unstoppable. In January he co-wrote an op-ed warning that China had set itself up for disaster. Its vaccines offer limited protection against Omicron, relatively few people have natural immunity and China’s health system is not equipped to handle a large wave. 

Since late last year Liang Wannian, a top Chinese epidemiologist, has been telling state media that China’s new “dynamic zero” policy does not mean zero infections and that the most stringent measures will not last forever. The policy means having zero tolerance for slow responses to outbreaks, he says.
