## To meet is ambitious growth target, China turns to stimulus
##### But it's the stealthy sort

Coal production is on the rise and the government says cleaner sources of energy must be in place before it decommissions dirtier plants (what it calls “establishing the new before abolishing the old”).

It will embark on some of the 102 “mega-projects” outlined in the five-year plan, which can be unpacked, like a “matryoshka doll”, into over 2,600 smaller projects, according to He Lifeng, the head of China’s planning agency. It will also spend more on unglamorous but necessary social infrastructure, such as day-care centres. About 9.8trn yuan will be transferred to cash-strapped local governments, 18% more than last year. They will need all the help they can get to cope with China’s property downturn, which has deprived them of revenue from land sales.
